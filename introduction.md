# 👋 Hello! My name is **Jon Reynol Burce!**

I'm so excited to learn more about **GitHub, Git, and programming languages** — but I know I’ll probably crash out in the middle of my late-night debugging sessions or even find myself questioning why I pursued this career (hopefully not🙂). Nevertheless, this will help me improve myself every single day in my tech career. 🚀

## 🎯 About Me

- 📍 From **Quinastillojan, Tabaco City, Albay**
- 🎓 First year student at **Bicol University** taking **BS in Computer Science**
- 💡 Reasons why I pursue this:
  1.  🧠 I want my college course to be aligned with my senior high strand, which is STEM.
  2.  💻 I have an interest in technology, especially in the software side of the field.
  3.  🏆 I chose this because I want to challenge myself and improve my skills in this field.
- 🌱 Inspired by the idea: “Small daily improvements = Big results”
- 🤔 I am still figuring out my path after college — currently choosing between:
  1. 🔒 Cybersecurity
  2. 📊 Data Analysis
  3. 🎨 Front-End Development (with UI/UX proficiency)

## 📚 Favorite Subject

I do not have one fixed favorite subject.

- ✨ Some topics really catch my interest → then it feels like my favorite.
- 😵 Other topics are tough or less interesting → then it feels like I dislike them.

∴ So, my “favorite subject” changes depending on the topic being studied.

## 💻 Dream Project

Build a **stunning and aesthetic website** with strong **UI/UX design** that shows mastery of:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
