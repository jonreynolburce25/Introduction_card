# 👋 Hello! My name is **Jon Reynol Burce!**

I'm so excited to learn more about **GitHub, Git, and programming languages** — but I know I’ll probably crash out in the middle of my late-night debugging sessions. However, this will help me improve myself every single day in my tech career. 🚀

## 🎯 About Me

- 📍 From **Quinastillojan, Tabaco City, Albay**
- 🎓 First year student at **Bicol University** taking **BS in Computer Science**
- 🌱 Inspired by the idea: _“Small daily improvements = Big results”_
- 🤔 I am still figuring out my path after college — currently choosing between:
  1. 🔒 Cybersecurity
  2. 📊 Data Analysis
  3. 🎨 Front-End Development (with UI/UX proficiency)

## 📚 Favorite Subject

I do not have one fixed favorite subject.

- ✨ Some topics really catch my interest → then it feels like my favorite.
- 😵 Other topics are tough or less interesting → then it feels like I dislike them.

∴ So, my “favorite subject” changes depending on the topic being studied.

## 💻 Dream Project

Build a **stunning and aesthetic website** with strong **UI/UX design** that shows mastery of:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## 📚🎮🖌️ Hobbies

- 😴💤 Sleeping (especially in cold weather 🌧️)
- 🎮 Playing video games (Valorant, formerly Mobile Legends 🎯)
- 🎶 Listening to hype music (_fav artists: kiyo & Chase Atlantic_)
- 📖 Learning and studying on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)
- 🌐🔒 Studying cryptocurrency especially memecoins to understand how the world
  works and stay updated about the world news and trends.
